            <p>Boxers are excellent guard dogs and can make for excellent protectors. If you need a dog that is well equipped to guard and protect your home and possessions from potential intruders, then you should consider a boxer. They are also good pets for any person who likes to go on walks or hikes and would appreciate having a running buddy.</p>
